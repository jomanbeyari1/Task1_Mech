3D design of a screw and a hex nut.

First: screw design.
screw is used for fasten materials together securely, and here is the 3D design:

second: hexagonal nut or hex nut design.
Hex nuts are commonly used in mechanical and construction applications to secure bolts and screws.
They provide a strong fastening solution and are often used in machinery, automotive components, and structural assemblies, and here is the 3D design:
